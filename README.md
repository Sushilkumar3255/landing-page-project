# Description

This pull request introduces a landing page project built using HTML and CSS. I've used the **flex-box** feature of CSS to design this Landing Page so that it can be responsive to different sizes of Web-page.
The page contains 5 different sections(including the header and footer), and the structure of these sections is made through HTML while designing through CSS.
I have designed the Ticket booking website.

A screenshot of the landing page is included in this PR for reference.
